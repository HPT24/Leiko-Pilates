                    <p class="quote__text">We have been seeing Leiko for 2 to 1 sessions for a number of years now, and she is the most fabulous teacher. Leiko really puts you at ease and understands you and your abilities. I love the reformer sessions with her as it is an hour of low impact but challenging exercise, in a safe relaxing environment. Leiko is especially wonderful with my daughter who is a vocational ballet student. With her background in ballet, she understands what Erin needs to work on to maintain her all round strength and flexibility. Leiko has this natural ability to adapt the exercises to suit what Erin needs, whilst also being suitable for me too. We love our sessions with Leiko!

She has a deep understanding of how bodies move and can explain and demonstrate how to strengthen different muscles to correct weakness. Leiko has helped me through a painful hip injury, knee injury, and finally a hip replacement. My whole body feels stronger, so much so that I have recently taken up dragon boat paddling. Thank you, Leiko!

                    <p class="quote__text">I've been doing reformer classes with Leiko now for about 18 months, both in small groups and 121s. She is by far the best instructor I've ever had, with advanced practitioner knowledge and skill which she can apply to complete beginners or those more used to Pilates and reformer equipment. She's very kind and patient, but also ambitious for you to grow in your practice and develop your skills. As someone who had never really enjoyed mat Pilates, I absolutely love my sessions with Leiko, and always come away feeling refreshed and motivated. I'd highly recommend Leiko as an instructor - you'll see the results, and you'll have fun as well!

Having her as your Pilates instructor would be a blessing, highly recommended!

                      <p class="quote__text"> I first met Leiko at a local studio when she was a Reformer group class instructor there.  It was evident very quickly that she was something special.  This prompted me to have 1:1 sessions with her.  Leiko has a special skill that she is able to see quickly when things are not quite right and able to rectify you to get the best out of any session.  Her knowledge of the body and what it can achieve (when you think it cannot) and her attention to detail of the body is outstanding. If it had not been for Leiko I would not have gained the skills to do reformer pilates as safely as I have achieved my goals with her.  She adapts to what you want to achieve. She has supported me through rehab following an operation. She is kind and encouraging whilst pushing you to achieve your best.  Leiko has seriously changed my life.  Thank you Leiko.
