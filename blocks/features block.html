      <p>Reformer Pilates is a fantastic way to exercise, especially for lower impact with targeted effects, and is a wonderful supplement to mat based practices as well as for rehabilitation from injury.</p>
      <p>Apparatus Pilates offers a broader range of equipment beyond the Reformer,
        such as the Cadillac, Combo Chair, and Ladder Barrel. Each piece of
        equipment offers unique exercises and challenges, contributing to a more
        diverse workout.
