            <p class="showcase__paragraph1" >Leiko Miura is a former professional ballet dancer who spent 10 years with the Birmingham Royal Ballet. She has 24 years of experience and understanding of individual needs. A one-to-one Reformer Pilates with Leiko adopts a body awareness approach to provide a tailored session to suit your body, mobility, ability and lifestyle.</p>
            <p>Leiko has a good understanding of hypermobility having experience of it herself, which helps her to adapt exercises for clients with this condition.</p>
            <p>This attention to detail derives from spending eight years working at a physiotherapy clinic in London. She has a great deal of experience from working alongside Alan Herdman, who opened the first Pilates studio in the UK in the early 1970â€™s.</p>
            <p class="showcase__paragraph4" >A Pilates reformer session with Leiko is detailed and precise. This will help you to reflect and adjust your habitual movements in daily life, to strengthen the weaker muscles. These weaker muscles are often the most challenging to activate and she will help identify and activate these to increase strength and mobility.</p>
