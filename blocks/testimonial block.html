              <p class="quote__text">Leiko is an incredible Pilates instructor, but she's also so much more than that!  Her personalised care, patience and attention have supported me through recovery from a back injury when, at times, I didn't think my body would work properly again.  Her key skill, which has always amazed me, is her ability to adapt and personalise her sessions to meet the specific needs of any given day or concern that I have.

                <p class="quote__text">I have been Leiko's client for more than 7 years. She has a deep understanding of how bodies move and can explain and demonstrate how to strengthen different muscles to correct weakness. Leiko has helped me through a painful hip injury, knee injury, and finally a hip replacement. My whole body feels stronger, so much so that I have recently taken up dragon boat paddling. Thank you, Leiko!

              <p class="quote__text">I've been doing reformer classes with Leiko now for about 18 months, both in small groups and 121s. She is by far the best instructor I've ever had, with advanced practitioner knowledge and skill which she can apply to complete beginners or those more used to Pilates and reformer equipment. She's very kind and patient, but also ambitious for you to grow in your practice and develop your skills. As someone who had never really enjoyed mat Pilates, I absolutely love my sessions with Leiko, and always come away feeling refreshed and motivated. I'd highly recommend Leiko as an instructor - you'll see the results, and you'll have fun as well!
